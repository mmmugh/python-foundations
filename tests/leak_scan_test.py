"""Check that .githooks/leak-scan blocks what it claims to, and nothing else.

    python3 tests/leak_scan_test.py

The scan guards a repo that is going public, so the cost of it silently
failing open is high and the failure is invisible: a scan that matches nothing
looks exactly like a clean commit. Its scope is also subtler than it appears,
and every rule below is one the scan documents and could lose to a careless
edit of leak-patterns.

Added lines only, so a leak can still be scrubbed out -- a scan that also
matched removed lines would make the fix un-committable. Added file paths too,
since a leak can hide in a filename. Generic patterns match case-sensitively,
so the lowercase "/users/" of a web route is not mistaken for a home
directory; personal literals in the untracked local file match
case-insensitively, because an employer's name is a name in any casing.

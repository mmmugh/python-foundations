"""Check that .githooks/pre-push scans what actually reaches the remote.

    python3 tests/pre_push_test.py

Builds a throwaway bare remote in a temp directory and pushes at it with the
repo's real hooks installed. Nothing here touches this repo or any network.

This is a separate test from leak_scan_test.py on purpose. That one asks
whether the scanner recognizes a leak in a diff it is handed; this one asks
whether the hook hands it the right diffs. The distinction is not academic:
the scanner was already correct when a push carrying a token in its history
sailed through, because the hook was feeding it the NET difference between
the two ends of the push. A leak added in one commit and deleted in the next
nets to nothing. The push was allowed and the remote's log held the token
twice -- which is the precise case a pre-push hook exists for, since anything
reaching it has already gone past pre-commit.
